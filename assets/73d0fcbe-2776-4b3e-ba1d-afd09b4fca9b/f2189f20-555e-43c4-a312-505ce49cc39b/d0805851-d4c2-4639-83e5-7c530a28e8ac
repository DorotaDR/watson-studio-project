These kids walk to school alongside their parents and most have never been further than walking distance from their house. For 80% of my students, English is not their first language or the language spoken at home. \r\n\r\nWhile my kindergarten kids have many obstacles in front of them, they come to school each day excited and ready to learn. Most students started the year out never being in a school setting. At the start of the year many had never been exposed to letters. Each day they soak up more knowledge and try their hardest to succeed. They are highly motivated to learn new things every day. We are halfway through the year and they are starting to take off. They know know all letters, some sight words, numbers to 20, and a majority of their letter sounds because of their hard work and determination. I am excited to see the places we will go from here!I currently have a differentiated sight word center that we do daily during our literacy stations. The students have activities that relate to whatever sight word list they are on. This is one of their favorite station activities. I want to continue to provide the students with engaging ways to practice their sight words. \r\n\r\nI dream of having the students use QR readers to scan the sight words that they are struggling with and the Ipods reading the sight words with them. This would help so many of my students by giving them multiple exposures to the words. My students need someone who can go over these sight words daily and I can't always get around to everyone to practice their flashcards with them. With the Ipods they would still have a way to practice their sight words on a daily basis."

My students' work is play. My work is to provide an environment rich in educational opportunities mistaken for play. My students are 3, 4, and 5 year old children with developmental delays, such as autism and cerebral palsy.\r\nThese delays require my students to work hard to achieve the skills that come to most children naturally. This causes them to have a higher level of frustration and a lower level of success. I strive to help my students succeed.When my students enter my classroom for the first, they are usually 3 years old and nonverbal. Many have received speech therapy from birth to 3, but most have not made significant communication progress.  My job as a teacher is help my students develop a functional form of communication. To do this we follow a structured protocol that always starts the same. Step one is to find several highly preferred toys, items, or activities. Step two is to remove those highly preferred items from the toys accessible to the child. Step three is to photo the items. Step four is to make the student exchange the photograph, called an icon, with a caregiver to receive the preferred item. Eventually this leads into our nonverbal students creating simple sentences using icons to communicate. For some of our students all the practice leads to verbalization. To facilitate the functional communication process the class needs lots of manipulatives with multiple pieces. As the child plays with these items, s/he will need additional pieces. To receive each piece the student is required to communicate by icon, icon sentence, or with words. The ability to communicate their wants and needs is something that comes naturally to most children. But for some children communication is such a challenge it causes them significant frustration. Imagine being the parent of one of these precious children and please consider donating towards helping some very special preschoolers find their voice. Thank you for considering this project for donation."

It's the first time either campus has done that in ten years!\r\n\r\nWhile on the social side of band; it is common for our students to move frequently, have no lunch money, rarely see one (or both) parents or deal with other life struggles. In those cases the band room becomes a safe-haven where everyone \""belongs\"" and everyone is a contributing member in some way. The weight of the world can be forgotten while playing a clarinet. And valuable mental skills are developed along the way.A guitar can't sound good with broken or worn out strings. This is also true of clarinets/saxophones and their reeds. One bad reed can ruin the sound of an entire band. Also like guitar strings, reeds eventually wear out. Two years ago we used this website to make quality replacement reeds available to students who couldn't afford to replace them. Afraid kids would take free reeds for granted, we have them do small chores around the band room in exchange for their reed (sort papers or music, sweep, stack chairs, etc). Thus the name \""Deeds for Reeds.\""\r\n\r\nDeeds for Reeds has been working GREAT! So great, in fact, that we've run out of reeds! We've also been able to extend the program to beginner books and other small supplies. Both JH and HS bands here at Linden-Kildare made vast improvement the past two years and we hope to grow on that success. Without good reeds, that won't be possible.\r\n\r\nIt's been encouraging to see that students understand and appreciate working for their reeds. It's become a bit of an institution here in the LK band program and lots of jokes and laughs come from it. Kids even argued about who would be in the picture and what kind of faces and poses would be best. Please help us continue 'Deeds for Reeds!'\r\n\r\n"

If this project gets funded, my students will get to create projects and share their understanding with their parents at quarterly conferences they will lead. My vision is that each student will create a portfolio where they can store their work and come back to. Not only will students be allowed to show work they create, they will also use the iPads to share their reading skills with their parents through a Reading App called 'Raz Kids.' On the iPads, students will be able to read with their parents and show their parents their progress in reading. They will be able to show them each reading level they grow and how they can answer questions to stories they have read through the app.\r\nThe possibilities of parent involvement with the iPads and student-led conferences are truly endless. The goal of this project is to get students to take charge of their learning, even in Kindergarten, and to get their parents invested in their student's learning.\r\n"

Everyday I have students ask to use something as simple as markers or watercolor paints, and everyday I have to tell them that they can not simply because we don't have them. \r\nArt is that special class that students get to go to where they feel like they can express themselves freely without worrying about right or wrong answers. I want nothing more than to be able to give that experience to each and every student.

When it becomes work it doesn't. The untrained eye might look at a k-2 classroom and see nothing more than play, but to those who understand they will see learning taking place. There is so much to learn in first grade. At just six years old we are tasked with learning to code words and read. We are tasked with recognizing numbers, understanding, and decomposing them. It can be overwhelming but if done through play the task becomes fun and games. Without even realizing what is happening the brain takes it in and makes sense of it all.\r\nToo often in today's world our little ones are fully engaged with technology. While technology is an undeniable part of our society, and a great way to aid learning, it can be too much at such a young age. Socialization and contact with the real world is important at this age and the OSMO system bridges the gap between these two things to create the ultimate fun learning experience! I've seen this in classrooms and it works! It helps even those who seem to be struggling with learning to decode words suddenly taking charge of their learning because they are able to see it as a fun game and not as a boring, stressful intervention used to help them \""catch up\"" because they are already behind."

I am asking for CD players to allow all my readers to access books that they are interested in. \r\n\r\nI don't want my struggling readers to lose their love of reading before they even have an opportunity to experience everything it has to offer. One of the biggest struggles for my low readers is the lack of reading content appropriate for their grade level. When their peers are talking about books they read that my lowest readers cannot access, reading can be very disheartening for them, embarrassing even. A combination of reading from their own books and listening to audiobooks will allow them to not only practice what they need to, but they will also be able to partake in reading discussions with their peers. There is nothing better than a struggling reader declaring that he or she has finished a chapter book and loved it."

The chrome books would be a great enrichment tool to allow students to go on visual field trips by visiting many different museum sites, photos and video footage, and art enrichment.  Chrome books could be used to video students at the art show talking about their art work.  The chrome books would allow art support for special needs students and various apps would be useful for digital art creation.  Students will be able to use a variety of websites for digital storytelling and design. The chrome books allows the students to show their work in a creative, digital format. The digital formats allow for publication and sharing of projects with a wider audience. We a do several art projects inspired by artist such as Andy Warhol and Chuck Close and chrome books would allow the students to be able to edit their own photos to use for the the assigned projects. \r\n\r\n Chrome books would  allow students to access their work anytime and anywhere. They would be able to create and curate their own gallery, select pieces they want, move them around and share them privately or publicly.

We have one of the largest enrollments of English as a New Language Learners in any elementary school in our city. The challenges these kids face are amazing. Many are learning to speak English for the first time, even as they continue to develop and master their native tongues at home. \r\n\r\nThere are over a dozen languages and dialects represented in our school.

What is more amazing than all of this, however, is the dedication these students show day in and day out as they strive to reach all of their personal, social, and academic goals.One of the greatest challenges to getting my students up and active at home is the lack of knowledge on the part of their parents and caregivers regarding what constitutes safe and appropriate physical education activities in the home.

A vast majority of my student (90%) receive free and reduced lunch at school.

Being able to provide our students with the best equipment is always a struggle.\r\nOur students love basketball and to helping out. They love being out there competing and being with their teammates. The problem is that we need shirts so we can referee our youth league.   \r\n\r\nA couple of our players came to me and asked if we could get some referee shirts to help to ref the games.  Money is always an issue in our community, especially in schools for items outside of the classroom. That is when one of our students suggested something that she had heard about in one of her other classes called Donorschoose. \r\n\r\nThis project would allow us to have 16 shirts so we would be able to have multiple games played at a time.  This would mean more games will be played and the youth players would have the opportunity to be active and participating and not standing there waiting on games, because with this project we would be able to have more than one game playing at a time. We believe that is would help keep the league more fun and upbeat and keep the students interested. \r\n"

My students are starting to understand how to use their knowledge of letters and the sounds they make to write and read words! Using the magnetic boards will help my students manipulate letters without having to spend time searching for be letters they need to build words. With the magnetic boards, students can build words in a small group with their teacher, or individually at a word work center. They can also practice building their sight words. There will be many learning opportunities available with the addition of the magnetic letter boards in our classroom."

This will allow our students to begin thinking about career paths at an early-age and to develop confidence with a positive mindset concerning the STEM content areas.We are looking to add robotics, coding, and programming to our STEM lab in a rural school.  But, we are currently lacking the technology to accomplish this with our students.  We believe a set of three GoPiGo Robot Starter Kits and Raspberry Pi computers would be the perfect fit to introduce hands-on innovation.  \r\n\r\nA set of three Raspberry Pi computers to program three GoPiGo Robots can engage a variety of grade levels covering a variety of STEAM topics and disciplines.  For example, younger programmers can be introduced to coding by moving the robots through a maze or competing in a robot soccer match.  More students can learn about planets and program the GoPiGo to explore as a planetary rover.  We could transform our robots to become reptiles and utilize heat sensors to explain cold-blooded tendencies of different animal species.  Our robot platform can even spark a new innovative invention to help people.  The possibilities to engage our students through collaboration are endless!\r\n\r\nPlease consider helping us utilize the GoPiGo robot kits as a medium to learn STEM content.  Robotics cultivates creativity and provides authenticity to a curriculum.  It allows ideas to become reality through brainstorming and constructing a robot or program.

My class is comprised of 17 students with cross-categorical disabilities (Autism, Cerebral Palsy, Communication, Developmental Delay, Intellectual Disability, Other Health Impairment, etc.). We are in need of multiple classroom iPads, but I thought I would start by requesting donations for one. \r\n\r\niPads are powerful learning tools. iPads come with assistive features that have changed the learning landscape for students with special needs. These innovative technologies allow every student to experience fun and function. Features like Guided Access, Speak Selection, Siri, Dictation, iBooks, Safari Reader, dictionary, FaceTime, Photo Booth, Camera, Word Prediction, Photos and iMovie, Voice Over, Zoom, Invert Colors, mono Audio, Closed Captions, Garage Band, and Assistive Touch. Not to mention the possibilities with apps.Donations to this project will promote student engagement through the use of technology; an iPad.\r\n\r\niPads can be used as a therapeutic devices. For children lacking motor skills, touch screens are more intuitive devices. Traditionally, computers and older technology required visual shifting between a mouse or keyboard and the screen.  With the iPad, students can watch as one of their fingers directly writes on the screen to make selections, which in turn helps improve fine motor skills. Using touch technology in devices such as the iPad seems almost natural to students with autism.\r\n\r\nFor any student, including students with disabilities, it is important to understand each individual and how differently some may learn.  With iPads, teachers can create personalized lesson plans assessing the needs of each individual. There are a vast amount of apps available for the iPad specifically tailored to special needs children.  Given the options, teachers can choose which apps best fit their teaching methods relevant to the way their students learn.\r\n\r\nThe way special needs students are learning from iPads is truly remarkable.  It is changing the way they are being taught in schools, improving aspects of their lives we couldn’t have imagined.\r\n\r\nHelp my students get the most out of their educational experiences! Help me engage them in their learning!"

They will not only be reinforcing what they have learned but teaching their peers as well (if you can teach it then you have really learned it). Furthermore, the majority of my students are English language learners so this dramatic play will also give them the opportunity to practice not only conversational English but the much needed academic language and vocabulary that is most necessary in mastering content-specific areas such as math, science, and history. \r\n\r\nThrough the purchase of these materials, we will have a puppet theater, ready made hand puppets, and hand puppets that each child can create and bring to life, adding a personal touch to their puppet.

I am asking for pencils, pencil sharpeners, and erasers for our daily learning activities. We constantly sharpen and write every minute of the day in order to learn our new concepts. My focus is on creating a psychologically-safe learning environment for my students. By eliminating the anxiety that comes when students worry about being called out or humiliated in front of their peers for not having their materials, I can reduce the chance that students will skip class, give up, become defiant, or develop mysterious “illnesses” that cause them to stay home. Obviously, these students struggle with remembering supplies. This is likely the result of many factors in their lives, none of which has anything to do with the classroom.

There is no greater joy than giving students the extra boost they need to succeed. We are a very diverse school with students who are in great need. They receive free breakfast and lunch and we try to provide the basic school essentials like backpacks and school supplies.\r\nHaving WOBBLE stools will help my students to be able to move as they work on improving their reading skills. They are constantly in motion and have trouble staying seated during our small reading group time. \r\n\r\nI want my students to be able to use movement in a positive way as they work hard to become great readers. The chairs I currently have are hand me downs that are on their last legs. New WOBBLE stools will allow them to use all that energy as a tool to focus. They are constantly on their knees on their chair, standing beside it, or rocking it back and forth on it. I KNOW they need to move and these stools will help us to accomplish both."

My seventh grade language arts students love all things technology, but you should see how their faces light up when they are given the opportunity to create things with their hands!  They are amazed!  Sometimes I think we get so lost in digital creativity, that we don't place enough value in our students' \""analog\"" experiences.  I value both and aim to teach my very talented students to do so, too.  I want to give them experiences in their education that they might not otherwise have.\r\n\r\nI continue to be amazed at the energy and creativity my students have when given the opportunity to create while they learn. My seventh-graders, most born and raised in this small town, have big  plans and big dreams, and my job is the encourage the creativity and thinking that will help them achieve those goals!Part of making education memorable is to make it ENGAGING.  I am learning to use Ron Clark Academy methods and would like to try my first classroom transformation.  By transforming my classroom into a campground, many of my students will get to experience the curriculum in a way that they can't when they're just sitting in desks.\r\n\r\nThe experiences that children remember from their school days are the experiences that take their education outside-the-box. I plan to create a memorable experience for my students as they read myths and identify words that have Greek and Latin roots in them, and then decode a puzzle to match each myth with its constellation.  They'll remember this activity around the \""campfire\"" for years to come."

Oh, well, they are awesome, of course! At least that's how I feel. I am privileged to teach at the same school that I attended when I was younger, so I definitely feel connected with my students. I know many of their parents, siblings, and family members, which also means I do have quite a bit of knowledge about their home life as well. Unfortunately, our community has had it a bit rough the past few years. Many of the companies that once employed large amounts of our citizens have moved out of the area. This has resulted in our school having a very high poverty rate (over 70%). Though we are a low income school, because of local politics, our school does not receive Title I funding, which makes things even more difficult for our teachers and students. \r\n\r\nThough our schools and teachers try their hardest, there's no way to keep this unfortunate statistic from affecting their education. We do try to make the best of it though. Our community supports us through school spirit, and our teachers try to keep a positive environment in their classrooms.Flexible seating arrangements is a unique teaching method that allows students more seating choices in the classroom in order to make students more comfortable in the learning environment. Adding elements that create a more \""home-like\"" environment creates a link between home and the classroom that makes it easier to focus in both places. Think about when you have read a book or studied at home. Was it at the kitchen table, sitting straight up using only a small amount of work space? Or did you have your materials laid out with your knees beneath you on a cushion or even in the floor or on your bed, studying while lying down? Most people, if given the choice, do not sit up straight with a two foot by two foot work space when they really want to focus- so why would we create a learning environment that goes directly against our own personal choices? Even as adults in the work place, we often have our own storage space and seat with a cushion. Not to mention that conventional classrooms are not universal for student bodies, some need more room or better options. Consider students who are taller than average, shorter than average, or even left handed. The typical desk often does not meet the needs of these students.\r\n\r\nSchools and classrooms that have implemented this arrangement have found that students' grades have improved, students seem happier and more engaged, and students are participating more and are having more invigorating conversations.  Students are able to feel more confident and comfortable, thus, are more willing to try new and more difficult concepts. Even Marzano would make the argument that if you are physically uncomfortable, you will have a hard time concentrating."

They drive their instruction based on where they are, not where the teacher is teaching.  My school is located next to a cow pasture, but we don't just stand around mooing.  We are taking charge of our learning and growing leaps and bounds.  Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “The purpose of life is not to be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.” \r\nWhen I was in high school, I was a majorette in our band.  I got in shape, had a purpose that kept me focused, and made friendships that will last a lifetime. \r\nOur school is starting  a club rotation where the students can learn new skills or hobbies so they can find something they are passionate about.

When students have a passion, it helps them focus in all areas of their life.  It gives them a purpose."

My school is labeled Title I (highest poverty), which means we have a lot more challenges, school budget being one of them. We are given all the academic materials that we need to teach them, but there is no budget for classroom environment or innovation. Classroom environment is very important to me as well as creative innovative new ways to engage students and make learning fun.Several times a day, my students come over to my teacher table for small group instruction. I am constantly refocusing them to pay closer attention to what we are doing. It is not always the most exciting time for my students especially for the ones struggling with the material, so it is a challenge to keep their focus. \r\nHaving flexible seating options will excite and encourage my students while at my table!  It also will help them stay focused. I have read multiple articles on flexible seating and all the positive feedback teachers are reporting.

All three teachers work as a team with all of the students with very flexible and fluid groupings. \r\n\r\nDespite the fact that my students come from a low socioeconomic area and many qualify as living within the poverty level, they continuously surprise me with positive attitudes and a love for learning.  We are a title 1 school, meaning that a large majority of my students receive free or reduced lunch. Many of these students look forward to school because they are fed and feel safe at school. On the other hand, we also have a large population of English Language Learners at our school. Many of my students look forward to having new opportunities presented to them in school because they have very limited experiences otherwise.One area that many students struggle with is focus. Today's classroom environment offers hard, stationary chairs and bright florescent lighting overhead. Today's students, on the other hand, want to MOVE! I know that I cannot focus, let alone stay awake when expected to work in this environment, unless I get up and move. \r\nMy students want the opportunity to be comfortable in their learning environment. We have a few \""special\"" seats in our classroom that have wheels on them and allow students to move while they are learning. When the rolling chairs run out, students beg to trade seats with their classmates and are disappointed when their only option is a normal chair. They ask me why we don't have movable chairs for everyone. I believe that giving my students the opportunity to move while they are learning helps them to stay focused and learn. It will benefit them tremendously both educationally and physically. \r\n"

Students participate in differentiated learning groups throughout the day to incorporate movement.

I am a strong believer in not only exercising your mind, but also your body to focus, grow, and learn.According to the Livestrong Foundation, when students utilize stability balls, both sides of their brain are actively engaged. When the brain is stimulated, it is more focussed on learning. This results in students being able to better concentrate on exams, note-taking, class discussions, and other areas in the classroom.\r\n\r\nHaving a classroom with a variety of students who possess individual and unique learning styles and challenges, I recognize the need for alternative seating. Allowing the students to redirect their \""fidgiting\"" by using stability balls will aid in helping them express excess energy and help them focus. \r\n\r\nIn this specific project, I plan on using the stability ball chairs in guided reading and math groups.

One of the biggest goals we have here in the middle school is to broaden the horizons of our students. The greater their awareness of the world outside of their immediate life, their desire to succeed in school grows.Last year, I was able to successfully have a class set of the first volume of the Ms. Marvel series funded through the generous donations from people on Donor's Choose. Having now used the book two years in a row, I can safely say it has been a great success. The students have loved the unit that goes with the reading, and many of my struggling readers have successfully finished the book. Furthermore, we saw growth in my students' reading scores on standardized exams. More importantly though, some of my most reluctant readers loved the series.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to foster the growing love of reading. After finishing the first volume, my students wanted to know what happened next for Ms. Marvel (the first book ends on a partial cliffhanger - the true antagonist's identity is revealed on the final page). I had two copies of the second volume that I purchased myself, but those are not enough to meet the demand. \r\n\r\nIf I have a class set of the second volume, which wraps the first conflict the hero faces, I can also extend the unit of study. We use Ms. Marvel to talk about the Hero's Journey, and use it to draw parallels to other famous stories of heroes. With the second volume, students will be able to fully compare all twelve parts of the journey to Ms. Marvel. In turn, the superhero narratives we wrote last year can become more in-depth and detailed with the more complete example."

They want to be able to wiggle and move their bodies in order to focus as well as get exercise. \r\n\r\n  During our community circle, we talked about what a perfect class is. They mentioned they wanted to have a safe, active, classroom that cares about each other. A few of my students said that seats that move would help them move and not get restless. The Hokki Stool and Kore wobble chair would provide movement for kids. \r\n\r\nThey also requested the folding cycle to put under a desk, so they could pedal while sitting down. One student mentioned that he wanted to stand in class because it was hard to sit. He thought a stand-up desk would help him stay active while learning.  This Safco Stand-up desk has a pendulum swinging footrest bar that enables students to wiggle their feet around while standing. \r\n\r\nAll of these things would help everyone be active at least 60 minutes a day.

Students will write about their favorite part of the story.  As the year progresses, students will write about the story that they have listened to using the story elements: characters, setting, beginning, middle, end.  As the students rotate to the listening center, the teacher will work with a small group of students on guided reading.  During this guided reading time, the students will practice reading with the teacher to improve their reading skills and comprehension skills.  It is also a time when the teacher evaluates the students' reading abilities to individualized her reading instruction."

They are very active and benefit from sensory input while working to allow their brains to think and allow their bodies the activity they need on an ongoing basis.My students are a diverse group of learners - each with his or her own talents and ways of learning. But many of them need movement in order to allow them to focus. Being stuck at a desk all day is one of their most common complaints.\r\n\r\nMy students feel that if they could choose seating options allowed feel a chance to wiggle and get out their energy, they would perform better in class.\r\n\r\nThese supplies will help them maintain focus and allow them the ability to pay attention and meet many of their learning goals. The stools are additions that add even more options for the children. The difference in their level of engagement is directly related to their ability to be comfortable and that includes body movement.\r\n\r\nMy students will be able to use the materials to help them remain focused in class. The seat bands allow their feet to be active while to are able to sit and complete their work. And the fidgets, clipboards, auditory feedback phone, and other items will allow students to work around the classroom while being focused."

These books could be the books that make my students fall in love with literature and make them soar throughout their educational career.My students are wonderful students. They are so eager to learn. They adhere to classroom rules and generally stay on task. However, as we know, students today are under enormous pressure. The expectation set for students today is very high.  Every year, students in my school are expected to reach the NYS goals for their grade regardless of the challenges that they face due to their circumstances. Many of my students have economic challenges and lack parental support. As a teacher, it is frustrating to know that many of your students are at a disadvantage, but must still meet their state standards and expectations. The reality is that not all students have books at home. I also have students with IEPs and English Language Learners. These students need to develop and catch up to their grade expectations and these books can help develop their fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension.After meeting with me during the guided reading block, they will work independently or in groups on the strategies that we worked on together as a group.  When I'm working with one group, the others will be working in different stations, for example, some will be reading silently, while others will be practicing their fluency with a partner with a timer, and/or another group will be writing about what they're reading.Guided reading has significant beneficial effects on helping my students develop reading skills. It is one of the most effective tools not only to improve  my students' fundamental reading skills but also to help them develop higher level comprehension skills.  With guided reading I can help establish fundamental skills necessary for proficient reading, identify weaknesses and strengthen specific skills, improve attention to detail, build fluency, expand vocabulary knowledge PLUS it's enjoyable."

Alternative seating in our classroom allows students to make a choice of which seating arrangement is best for their learning. By giving them a choice I am helping them begin to learn how to make appropriate choices to make them more successful in the classroom.

(Part 1)I am determined to provide my amazing students with a high-quality, 21st century, college-prep education. I do not want the challenges of teaching in an urban public school in an under-resourced community to eclipse the many joys that occur when students are set up for success.\r\n\r\nMy school is located in the poorest Congressional district in the country, but that does not stop my students from coming to school with high hopes for their future.  After all, if Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Grandmaster Flash also came from this same neighborhood, what's stopping my students from dreaming big? Despite sometimes enormous obstacles at home and in their communities, my students are full of good will, and they are eager for culturally relevant instruction, texts that speak to their lived realities, and learning activities that kindle the sparks of intellectual rigor. And in order to achieve this, they need access to technology that facilitates meaningful and engaged learning.I am hoping to provide my students with a full class set of Chromebook laptops.  I have had this goal for several years.  In today's English classroom, robust literacy instruction depends on regular and reliable access to technology.  In my school, technology is in high demand but short supply.  To complicate matters, as in many high-poverty areas, most of my students do not have computers at home, making it all the more urgent that they have functioning technology at school with which they can enhance their literacy skills.  \r\n\r\nA class set of Chromebook laptops would ensure that all of my students have constant opportunities to read, write, listen, view, think--and create!  I envision these laptops being used every day.  My students could read articles, mentor texts, and primary sources related to the novel we're reading in class.  They could write individually in Google Classroom and blogs; they could write collaboratively on Google Docs.  Students with learning disabilities and those who are English Language Learners could use a wide range of software to support their comprehension and scaffold their writing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a set of classroom Chromebooks would enable my students to execute long-term projects.  The final part of the year is dedicated to Exhibitions, which are interdisciplinary projects that culminate in a research paper, a creative component, and a public presentation.  Students could use these Chromebooks--even with the option of borrowing one to use at home--to create Prezi slideshows, podcasts, infographics, and multi-genre writing pieces.

An AED is a device that delivers an electric shock through the chest to the heart. The shock can stop an irregular rhythm and allow a normal rhythm to resume in a heart in sudden cardiac arrest. We have many students who have medical concerns and as a precautionary measure an AED would be a huge asset to our school.\r\n\r\nAn AED would give our students and any adults around a greater chance at life if they had an event that could be helped by an AED.\r\nI lost my brother 2 years ago due to a cardiac arrest. A matter of 5 minutes to his location from an AED would have made all the difference in the world. All of our staff has been trained we just need more equipment."

This group of young scholars ages 3-6 have a strong desire to learn, to absorb information and to create. Dr. Montessori observed that this age group is full of naturally self-motivated and self-driven individuals who are drawn to \""practical life\"" experiences. Because of this, she developed what she called “Practical Life Exercises” which allows each child opportunities to do activities of daily life.\r\n\r\n“The environment must be rich in motives which lend interest to activity and invite the child to conduct his own experiences.”\r\n—Dr. Maria Montessori\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nPractical Life is a crucial area of the Montessori curriculum. My 3-6 year old students love to prepare food, which is a real-life connection between school and home and is also crucial for planning and solving multiple-step processes.\r\nThe children easily spend well over 60 minutes a day practicing their food prep skills, and they continuously learn the importance of whole food eating through observation and conversation with the older students in our classroom.\r\nThis kid-inspired project is fantastic!\r\nDuring their third year in our classroom they use their perfected food prep skills to prepare actual meals on their own using only fresh fruits and vegetables, grains and dairy. The younger children assist.\r\nOur food prep area is growing, and the children have asked about growing their own herbs and vegetables. This inspired the children to suggest that we create an indoor garden that can be used during the winter. After some research, the children agreed upon an indoor garden kit with a light and watering can, a new refrigerator to store the food we grow, silverware sets for them to eat their incredible feasts, and pitchers for serving herb & fruit infused water.\r\nGrowing a garden, preparing and serving food, and sharing meals together are real world activities that teach the importance of Reading, Math, & Science! The process of researching whole food recipes with a friend reinforces cooperation skills, especially with projects like this that take more than 60-minutes to complete. We appreciate the opportunity that Target is giving to our students which will allow them to develop a deeper awareness of farm to table gardening, nutrient-dense whole foods, how things are made, and how to work with their friends."

One app that was introduced at our last professional development was called Chatterbox. It allows pictures to \""speak\"" using the child's own voice.

There are also many other apps which could enliven our lessons, and keep learning an active process. By having an IPad in the classroom, there is no limit to what we can access."

Last year we made history and took several boys to the FLYRA state finals where they placed 3rd overall as a middle school team.These items will help assist students to be prepared for track meets. Something as small as bags and socks are priceless items for these students. Those items cost money and many times they do not have the means to buy these necessities. In addition, the students need to be safe and hydrated at the track meets. The tent will help shade them from the blistering Florida sun and the water cooler and bottles will assist in hydration. \r\nProviding students with these essentials will allow students the opportunity to practice and perform to their full potential.  I want to level the playing field and ensure that these students on the team have nothing holding them back from succeeding."

Just over 60 years ago, my students' grandparents and great-grandparents attended schools that were woefully inadequate and legally segregated. Today, the rise of \""segregation academies\"" and the lack of sufficient funding for our schools--particularly those in high poverty towns, such as ours--mean that my students likewise attend schools that are inadequate and, effectively, still segregated.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the inequities in our school system, many of our students start off the school year hating reading and thinking that reading is an area where they can't be successful. It's our job to change that perception over the course of the year, and getting them engaging books is the best way for this to happen.Traditional English classrooms teach one whole class novel at a time. However, in a classroom with a diverse set of learners, this type of novel study might not meet the needs of all students. Our classes will contain readers whose levels range from a kindergarten or first grade level up to a seventh or eighth grade level. These students are not best served by reading the same texts; they need books near their level in order to maximize their engagement and reading growth.\r\n\r\nLiteracy circles, or \""book clubs,\"" allow students to maintain the community aspect of whole class novel studies, while also focusing on the skills that are the most relevant to them. Each book club reads a book and collaborates on assignments related to the book: written assignments, projects, discussions, and more. This gives them the joy that stems from sharing their reading experiences with their peers. Additionally, all of the book club books tie back to a central theme for the unit--exploration, freedom, social change--which allow the book clubs to be integrated into a cohesive whole class learning experience as well.\r\n\r\nBook clubs supplement whole class novel study. This way, students built literacy skills within both a smaller and a larger community. The themes in the contemporary fiction that we study in book clubs complement the historical themes of the novel study. For example, while studying slavery in history, the whole class will read Nightjohn, a book about a slave learning to read, and individual book clubs will read appropriate leveled books that connect to the themes of freedom and oppression from a modern-day perspective."

Many times my students are a distraction to others as well as themselves.  I want to be able to offer alternative ways that may be helpful in keeping the students in the classroom learning with their peers, instead of being pulled away one- on- one.Bouncy Bands for Chairs help students move while they work. Children enjoy bouncing their feet and feeling the tension to relieve their anxiety, hyperactivity, frustration, or boredom.\r\nThe support pipes attach to the Bouncy Band to prevent them from slipping off the chair legs and becoming a nuisance.  \r\nTeachers love how Bouncy Bands for Chairs are quiet and don't disturb or distract other students. Bouncy Bands are 100% safe. They are latex free and since children put their feet on the front two legs, it prevents them from leaning backwards (and falling).

Benjamin Franklin said, \""Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\"" How true that is in kindergarten!The iPads will be used in various ways during the course of the kindergarten day. There are an amazing number of applications that can be downloaded in all curricular areas. These apps will enable me to create individualize plans for students whether it be for practice, remediation or enrichment. During our literacy block, students can be working on letter identification, sound recognition, sight words, reading or listening to a book, writing stories, drawing pictures to go along with their stories or even taking pictures to illustrate their stories. In math, students can practice these skills: counting by ones, twos, fives and tens, practice addition and subtraction skills and place value, just to name a few. While in science, students can use the iPads to record the changing seasons by capturing these changes by camera. I look forward to finding additional ways my students can use the iPads to enhance their learning. Having cases to protect the iPads is a must with kindergarteners! \r\n\r\nHaving these iPads to use in my classroom will motivate my students to practice and learn the skills they need to reach their full potential."

Imagine walking into a classroom full of your peers, feeling like you can never quite measure up to them, not because they tell you so, but because you know that what may come easy to them is so hard for you.\r\n\r\nEvery child, despite what they may believe, CAN LEARN! They just need an environment in which their needs can be addressed and met. Despite their personal challenges, our students arrive in our classroom every day with a smile and a hug for us, and a desire to walk out of our room each afternoon having learned something new.  They are learning to embrace a growth mindset, even with frustrations and obstacles. Our students are so full of life, and they do want so badly to learn. Every advantage we can provide them will only help them to realize what amazing potential they have...and that they CAN realize that potential!\r\n\r\n\r\nWe all know students with disabilities struggle with academics and sometimes behavior, but many people don't realize that sensorimotor issues can create significant challenges for these students. Sitting in a rigid chair at a desk or table throughout the instructional day is next to impossible for my students. They are in constant motion, wiggling, rocking, kneeling and squatting on their seats, and standing up at random times. Flexible seating options like balance balls, wobble stools, and floor cushions will help my students to better regulate their bodies so that they are prepared to participate in the learning process.\r\n\r\nStudents who cannot sit still are not bored or \""hyperactive\"", but rather, are doing whatever they can to bring a sense of calm and balance to their bodies.  Traditional seating is uncomfortable for my students, and so instead of focusing their minds, they are spending all of their mental energy trying to focus and calm their bodies. Flexible seating options will help remove that obstacle so they can get down to the business of success!"
