Junior System Test Analyst,"GB, CMD, London",Technology,19000-19000,"The Technical Team and offering at VML London has a very strong heritage dating back to the mid-nineties when the London office was founded. Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.Open standards, open minds.We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","At VML, testing is an integral part of our software development process.

Ruby on Rails Developer,"GB, , Glasgow / Birmingham / London / Remote",,35-45,"Newspaper Club is a service to help anyone make and print their own newspapers. Our mission is to give people the tools to turn whatever they want into newsprint, quickly and easily.The company was founded in 2009 by Ben Terrett, Tom Taylor and Russell Davies, who felt that rumours of print’s death had been greatly exaggerated. And with more reading being done digitally, the joy of holding something physical was more important than ever. As an experiment, they designed a newspaper called Things Our Friends Have Written On The Internet. It delighted people so much that the seeds of Newspaper Club were born.With initial support from Channel 4’s innovation fund 4iP, the team worked on making the process of designing and printing a newspaper easier. The first step, producing a good-looking newspaper without expensive, complicated design software, was solved by the invention of ARTHR – Newspaper Club’s free layout tool. The next step, finding someone to print it on real newsprint, and understanding what on earth they’re talking about was addressed by partnering with established newspaper printers and building an easy-to-use web service, staffed by a team of friendly people.Since then, we've won a Design of the Year award for Graphics in 2010 and a BIMA for Technical Achievement, and we’ve grown to a team of 13, with offices in London, Birmingham and Glasgow.We’ve printed over 6 million newspapers for thousands of customers all over the world, including the BBC, Coca Cola, the Guardian, Penguin Books, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, and Sony Records.And yes, we're still excited about printing newspapers.","Newspaper Club helps people make and print their own newspapers.

Executive Director,"US, CA, San Franscisco",,60000-75000,"In 1998 a broad coalition of Bayview Hunters Point institutions and residents sought to implement findings and recommendations of neighborhood needs assessments and planning studies.

Local Representative,"US, FL, Gulf Coast Region",,,"ERG is a business and consumer law firm dedicated to helping its clients navigate the BP Claims Process. Almost every type of business on the west coast of Florida, and many individuals and professionals, may be qualified to particpate under this new BP funded program established as of June 4, 2012. The purpose of the program is to help Florida businesses and consumers recover from the direct and indirect impacts of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, and ERG and its team of lawyers and financial professionals are dedicated to ensuring that all of those impacted receive the quality representation they deserve. The ability to file a claim is time limited, so investigate your rights today to ensure that the intended benefits of the program are realized as Florida's economy continues to struggle. Visit #URL_70030a244afb9e0151ea2dcb7fe41f3026a714b37eef7f5e2494abafa40ae1fa# for more about ERG and whether you or your company may have a claim.",This is a fabulous opportunity to make a lot of cash.It can be done in your spare time.It just is not a full time job. I am a lawyer with Economic Recovery Group. Part of my job is recruiting local representatives for Economic Recovery Group. We have regional representatives along the whole coast to whom the local reps report.This is really more of a tool than a job. We are looking for people to find leads for our regional representatives to process and feed to our staff attorneys to process claims.,0,1,1,,,,,,"Brief Outline of Local Representative Position:Economic Recovery Group, LLC is a Florida law firm devoted to spreading the word to potential claimants about the new BP Horizon Settlement Program. We are looking for businesses, nonprofits and independent contractors who can produce 60 months of P &amp; L statements, had a downturn in 2010, and in 2011 show an upturn. There are 63 other ways to make a determination, but the general claim will follow that pattern. There are a few excluded classes – bankers, insurers, BP Station owners, investment advisers, casinos and local governments are probably the most common.If you find somebody who might be interested, refer him to a regional representative who will encourage him to fill out the paperwork to evaluate whether he may have file a claim. A staff attorney from our Winter Park office will contact him, assist him in putting together his documentation and filing a claim if there is one.We are also looking for groups to present to, and any leads that come from those meetings will belong to the local representative. We have presentations that someone from ERG lines up and will invite the local representatives to be there and give claim forms to those interested. These will become yours as well.As a local representative you will receive 1% of the claim amount when the client receives it from the BP Settlement. You have to do nothing other than refer the client to us.  Attorney client privilege attaches when they sign the documents and no-one but our staff attorney will be privy to any of the financial information. Your compensation comes from the attorney’s fee and in no way diminishes the recovery of the client.There is no production requirement. This is just an opportunity that you can take as much or as little advantage of as you want. You will be signed up as an employee of Economic Recovery Group as the State Bar of Florida requires that you be an employee. We will furnish business cards and marketing materials. You may also sign up additional local representatives by referring them to me. Anyone who comes on as a result will also earn 1% and you will receive an additional .25% of their production when realized.The disadvantage is that no one gets paid until and unless the claim is realized. Claims are currently taking six months from start to finish. So this is not something for anyone needing immediate cash. The average business claim, however, is running North of $250,000, so the opportunity is real. The hardest part of the job is to convince clients that they are in fact qualified to receive these funds.",0
